            <p>Gorillas are large, powerful apes primarily herbivorous, found in the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. They are the largest living primates, with males typically being significantly larger than females. Gorillas live in social groups called troops, led by a dominant male called a silverback. 
Key features of gorillas:
Size and Strength: Gorillas are the largest of the apes, with males reaching heights of up to 5.11 feet and weights of up to 600 pounds. 
Habitat: They inhabit tropical forests, mountains, and nearby savannas. 
Diet: Gorillas are primarily herbivores, eating mostly plant matter like fruits, leaves, and stems. 
Social Structure: Gorillas live in family groups or troops, usually with a dominant male (silverback) at the head. 
Endangered Status: Many gorilla species are classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial.
